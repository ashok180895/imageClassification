The project is about image classification using deep learning techniques. The dataset given are vehicle images which are synthetically generated with different angles and orientation of camera. To compare the models, first simple baseline model is implemented and network pruning method used. In network pruning method , the neurons are removed based on the weights with some threshold value. KNN clustering is used to classify with different hyper parameters are tested. To get the best hyper parameters Genetic algorithm is used for KNN clustering.
